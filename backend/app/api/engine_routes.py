"""Route bodies the Terraform and Docker endpoints share.

The route *functions* stay one-per-endpoint in their own modules, because their
names become OpenAPI operation ids and therefore the generated clients' method
names. Only the bodies that were genuinely identical move here.

The list endpoints deliberately stay put: their limits and orderings differ per
engine (a Docker findings list sorts by file and line, a Terraform one by
recency), so parameterising them would need more knobs than it saves.
